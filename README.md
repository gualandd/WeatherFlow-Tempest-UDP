# WeatherFlow - Tempest UDP & API Integration
UDP & Rest API integration with NodeRED for Home Assistant

This is a Node-Red flow that expose full metrics to MQTT only; no more direct exposure to Home Assistant due to resource demand of the HACS companion and to be usable for all.

The flow expose all the UDP Metrics & Data available on port 50222 plus some metrics from the Rest API url: for the correct run of the Rest API
is mandatory to insert in injection nodes the Tempest API and the Station ID.

The derived metrics are calculated & tested with the most recents formulas.
All entities created have the "tempest_" suffix.

********************************
Changelog 01/05/2021:

Removed the direct Home Assistant Exposure: now You have to create MQTT entities in Home Assistant from the configuration.yaml: the flow create a "Tempest_PWS" main topic that is nested with all the available data;

Removed Lightning Strike Distance & Date because no more available on API;

Added filtering function in Rain Ammount & Time due to possible false readings from Rest API: if rain is less than 0.5mm is filtered to 0mm ammount and 0min rain time otherwise actual data is published.
Added filtering function in Lightning detection to avoid false alarms: in lightning total day number is less than 5 is filtered to 0, otherwise actual number is published.

Partial rebuild of the flow to avoid problems with Node-Red Join node.
